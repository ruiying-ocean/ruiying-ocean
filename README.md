Hello, I am Rui Ying (Chinese: **Â∫îÈîê**), a scientist with expertise in marine ecosystem modelling from past to future. The following map explains my interests (a modelled species diversity using METAL theory). 

I study the fundamental regulation of marine ecology and simulate the realistic dynamic in a theoretical world. I also hope to understand the consequences of these biological/ecological processes, such as the carbon/oxygen cycles. These questions will determine our knowledge of the global climate, ocean environment, and food supply in the future.

My main research tools are ecosystem and biogeochemical model (coupled or not coupled) such as cGENIE, NEMO-PLANKTOM12.
