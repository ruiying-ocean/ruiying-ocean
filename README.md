### Hi there :alien:

Welcome to my Github page 😄. 

My name is Rui Ying (Chinese name: **应锐**), I'm currently studying in the University of Bristol as a 3rd year PhD student. My research is about marine ecology and biogeochemistry cycle. For example,

- what is the role of marine ecosystem in the global carbon cycle? 
- How will ecosystem react to environmental change?
- How is such interaction in the past ocean?

:computer:  <ins>I use a Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity ([cGENIE](https://github.com/derpycode/cgenie.muffin)) and observed planktic foraminifer data to answer these questions  </ins>. In case you don't know, planktic foraminifer is a group of zooplankton with CaCO3 shell. These shells sinked in to the deep sea floor and provide the most abudant microfossil samples. Since 1940s, we started drilling the sediment cores and use these samples to measure/infer temperature in the past.

:star2: So far, I have been involved developing the ForamEcoGENIE model in cGENIE, i.e., adding the planktic foraminifer into cGENIE model. I am also developing a Python Package, [cgeniepy](https://github.com/ruiying-ocean/cgeniepy). This package is developed to facilitate analyse and visualise cGENIE model output. It's also my first official open-source package.
