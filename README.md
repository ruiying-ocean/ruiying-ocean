WELCOME to my Github page üòÑ. My name is Rui Ying (Chinese: **Â∫îÈîê**), I'm a final year PhD student at the University of Bristol, UK. My research interests are marine ecology, climate change and biogeochemical cycle. The beauty of following map explains why (a modelled species diversity using METAL theory).

How to describe the dynamic of marine ecosystem in a mathematical manner is a challenging scientific question. Linking the biological processes to their functions like transfering energy and matter to different locations of world, sptaially or vertically, is a difficult task on another level. Different answers determine how we understand the global climate in the past and future, because the marine ecosystem is evidently an important node in global carbon cycle.

:computer:  <ins> I use a Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity ([cGENIE](https://github.com/derpycode/cgenie.muffin)) and observed planktic foraminifer data to answer these questions  </ins>. Planktic foraminifer is an intersting group of zooplankton with inorganic shell (CaCO3). These shells provide the most abudant microfossil samples in the world which are widely used to infer temperature in the past.

:star2: I have been already published the ForamEcoGENIE model, i.e., adding the planktic foraminifer groups into cGENIE model. A Python Package, [cgeniepy](https://github.com/ruiying-ocean/cgeniepy) is also accompanied to facilitate visualisation. Recently, I also submitted a new manuscript regarding foraminifera thermal niche in different ages, which can be found in the below preprint.
